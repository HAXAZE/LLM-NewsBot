## Features

- Processes over 1,000 lines of news articles for efficient retrieval.
- Uses the FAISS index for fast similarity search within a vector database.
- Integrates with the OpenAI API for generating relevant responses to user queries.
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for development.
- **OpenAI API**: For language model capabilities.
- **LangChain**: Framework for building applications powered by language models.
- **FAISS**: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building interactive web applications.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HAXAZE/LLM-NewsBotNavigate into the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd LLM-NewsBot
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Streamlit app:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501.
Enter your query in the input box to retrieve relevant news articles and insights.
How It Works
Data Processing: The project ingests and processes a large set of news articles, converting them into a suitable format for indexing.
Vectorization: Articles are vectorized using a language model from OpenAI to create embeddings for similarity search.
Indexing: FAISS is used to build an index of the vectors, allowing for fast and efficient retrieval.
Query Handling: When a user submits a query, the app uses the FAISS index to find similar articles and leverages OpenAI API for generating informative responses based on the retrieved content.
